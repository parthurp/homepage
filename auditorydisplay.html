      <p class="w3-text-grey"> <b> Context</b> <br> The eruption of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii in the summer of 2018 marked the end of a long eruption phase that began in 1983. <br> First, two "tectonic" earthquakes occur off the SE shore of the island. Soon after, seismicity migrates to and rapidly increases in the vicinity of the crater. Then it enters a phase in which a Mag. 5 earthquake occurred every single day for over a month, which is extremely rare. Each event was preceded by a rapidly increasing number of foreshocks (like popcorn popping) up to the time of the >M5, followed by a brief silence (~2 hours), and then a repeat. These earthquakes had no aftershocks, only foreshocks, which is also extremely rare. <br> Also, every day, there was an eruption of lava out of vents that were opening up about 40-50 km east of the volcano, down the rift. It is known that the lavas in the Kilauea caldera (crater) are the same as those that were erupting down the rift, strongly suggesting that the cyclic patterns reflected a coupling to the dynamics governing those eruptions. The scratching sound may be associated with magma moving through the crustal "plumbing system" to the vents. <br> Can we hear the spatio-temporal patterns? Can we track down the lava flow?</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> <b> Context</b> <br> In the subduction zone of the northwestern coast of the USA and Canada, "slow" earthquakes are observed (lasting ~ 2 weeks every 14 months in this region). <br> They send out very weak, but long-lasting seismic waves compared to regular earthquakes, called "tremor". <br> The location of the tremor in time - approximately the location where the slow-earthquake process is active - can be followed by locating the source of the seismic waves at depth (~ 40 km deep on the subduction fault). <br> The relatively slow velocity of the process allows us to track the slow-earthquake migration process along the fault. <br>Can you hear it moving?</p>

      <h1>Many many earthquakes at the Geysers Geothermal Field, CA</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> We got an article in Science Advances called "Machine learning reveals cyclic changes in seismic source spectra in Geysers geothermal field" (B. Holtzman, A. Pat√©, J. Paisley, F. Waldhauser, D. Repetto), whose abstract goes like this: <br> The earthquake rupture process comprises complex interactions of stress, fracture, and frictional properties. New machine learning methods demonstrate great potential to reveal patterns in time-dependent spectral properties of seismic signals and enable identification of changes in faulting processes. Clustering of 46,000 earthquakes of 0.3 < M L < 1.5 from the Geysers geothermal field (CA) yields groupings that have no reservoir-scale spatial patterns but clear temporal patterns. Events with similar spectral properties repeat on annual cycles within each cluster and track changes in the water injection rates into the Geysers reservoir, indicating that changes in acoustic properties and faulting processes accompany changes in thermomechanical state. The methods open new means to identify and characterize subtle changes in seismic source properties, with applications to tectonic and geothermal seismicity </p>
